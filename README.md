## Describe your project

My project is a simplified user program where the user can put their name, cost of items, and the amount that's currently in their cart. The subclasses also add possible messages if the user meets the right criteria. For example, if the user puts the answers to the questions as false, and 0, in that order, there's a message that will show after. Same applies to the Dairy subclass. 

Supermarket is the superclass
Meat is the subclass
Dairy is the other subclass. 

The entire project has 8 instance variables, varying from Strings, integers, doubles, and booleans. 

Instance Variables:

Strings: name,typeOfMeat
Integers: inCart,amountAvailable
Doubles: cost, 
Booleans: availability, inABottle, inACan

## What part of your project are you most proud of?

I'm most proud of the fact that I was able to get this to work. It took many lines of code, but in the end, the final product looks good. 

## Describe something you would improve or do differently if you had an opportunity to change something about your project.

What I would do differently about my project is to manage my time better. If I could figure out more efficient ways to create the program, that would help out a lot with the writing.
