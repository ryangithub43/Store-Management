## Describe your project

My project is a simplified user program where the user can put their name, cost of items, and the amount that's currently in their cart. The subclasses also add possible messages if the user meets the right criteria.

Supermarket is the superclass
Meat is the subclass

The entire project has 8 instance variables, varying from Strings, integers, doubles, and booleans. 

Strings: name, 
Integers:
Doubles:
Booleans:
